Amazon API Gateway, an AWS service, is rapidly changing how every company, from 2-person startups to the largest of the Fortune 100, think about building and delivering serverless and traditional applications in the cloud. API Gateway is the front-door of the Serverless revolution, an approach that lets customers turn business logic and application code into scalable, fault-tolerant production without requiring every developer to become an expert in deployment technologies, and infrastructure management. API Gateway turns daunting tasks such as traffic management, authentication, and authorization, monitoring and API versioning into easily configurable steps. It then helps companies to build their developer eco- and turns their sets and business logic into new revenue streams.  We are looking to grow our API Gateway console development team to help design and deliver new customer facing features for our HTTP APIs product and migrate our REST APIs product to the HTTP APIs platform. We acknowledge that there's room for improvement in our customer experience so we're looking for engineers who are customer obsessed. Being customer obsessed will ensure we're delivering a user interface that exceed our customers expectations. We have a modern React JS based code base that leverages AWS component based design system. For this role in specific, our ideal candidate has a deep understanding of browser technology along with ReactJS, Redux, CSS and HTML. Which will enable them to help set the technical direction for our front end solutions.  About Us  Inclusive Team Culture Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee- led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.  Work/Life Balance Our team puts a high value on work-live balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment.

Amazon API Gateway, an AWS service, is rapidly changing how every company, from 2-person startups to the largest of the Fortune 100, think about building and delivering serverless and traditional applications in the cloud. API Gateway is the front-door of the Serverless revolution, an approach that lets customers turn business logic and application code into scalable, fault-tolerant production without requiring every developer to become an expert in deployment technologies, and infrastructure management. API Gateway turns daunting tasks such as traffic management, authentication, and authorization, monitoring and API versioning into easily configurable steps. It then helps companies to build their developer eco- and turns their sets and business logic into new revenue streams. <br><br> We are looking to grow our API Gateway console development team to help design and deliver new customer facing features for our HTTP APIs product and migrate our REST APIs product to the HTTP APIs platform.

We have a modern React JS based code base that leverages AWS component based design system. For this role in specific, our ideal candidate has a deep understanding of browser technology along with ReactJS, Redux, CSS and HTML. Which will enable them to help set the technical direction for our front end solutions. <br><br> About Us <br><br> Inclusive Team Culture <br>Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee- led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally.
