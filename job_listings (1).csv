 Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world leader in providing a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers tens of thousands of businesses around the world! Amazon API Gateway, an AWS service, is rapidly changing how every company, from 2-person startups to the largest of the Fortune 100, think about building and delivering serverless and traditional applications in the cloud. API Gateway is the front-door of the Serverless revolution, an approach that lets customers turn business logic and application code into scalable, fault-tolerant production without requiring every developer to become an expert in deployment technologies, and infrastructure management. API Gateway turns daunting tasks such as traffic management, authentication, and authorization, monitoring and API versioning into easily configurable steps. It then helps companies to build their developer eco- and turns their sets and business logic into new revenue streams.  We are looking to grow our API Gateway console development team to help design and deliver new customer facing features for our HTTP APIs product and migrate our REST APIs product to the HTTP APIs platform. We acknowledge that there's room for improvement in our customer experience so we're looking for engineers who are customer obsessed. Being customer obsessed will ensure we're delivering a user interface that exceed our customers expectations. We have a modern React JS based code base that leverages AWS component based design system. For this role in specific, our ideal candidate has a deep understanding of browser technology along with ReactJS, Redux, CSS and HTML. Which will enable them to help set the technical direction for our front end solutions.  About Us  Inclusive Team Culture Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee- led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.  Work/Life Balance Our team puts a high value on work-live balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.  This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice. We have a on boarding process to ensure a gradual and supportive transition into going on call.  Mentorship & Career Growth Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

  We are a passionate team who care deeply about our customers and our teammates. In this role, you will work directly with Product Management, Architects, our Design and other engineering teams to help derive the best experience for the customer. We have a lean process that focuses on empowering and serving our engineers as opposed to just directing them.

   Impact. We give our engineers an environment in which they can contribute from day one while also providing opportunities for learning and growth.
   Skilled and dedicated peers, all the way from engineering to product management and customer support. We are an engineering and product-focused company. Our engineers take a leading role in designing, architecting, building and testing our product.
   Growth and mentorship. We believe in growing engineers through ownership and leadership opportunities. We also believe mentors help both sides of the equation.
   A stable, collaborative and supportive work environment. We are totally remote friendly. You can choose to work from a Splunk location or you can be in any US time zone and work with the rest of the team around the globe.
   Work-life balance. We don't expect people to work 12-hour days. We want you to have a successful time outside of work too. We trust our colleagues to be responsible with their time and commitment, and believe that balance helps cultivate an outstanding environment.
 
  In this role, you will
 
  Build a global-scale, security detection platform, optimizing for performance, reliability and quality using Splunk platform innovations, open-source, and cloud tools and technologies.

  Have broad cross-functional or cross-product impact in the organization and help set strategic direction for products and technology
  Influence and achieve results through recognized technical expertise and thought leadership in the industry
  Collaborate with team members on the design and implementation of frameworks and backend components and mentor junior engineers, to help develop their technical skills, communication and careers
  Participate in high-profile and critical customer engagements and meet with customers as needed
  Be actively involved in hiring of technical leads, architects, and senior engineering leaders
 
  Requirements
 
  Minimum of 15+ years experience with a Bachelor’s degree; or 12+ years with a Master’s degree in a related field.
  Extensive experience architecting scalable distributed web applications. Experience transitioning from monolithic architecture to scalable distributed systems is a plus.
  Track record of leadership roles with demonstrated ability to strategically plan and execute both incremental improvements and revolutionary changes.
  Strong expertise with the developer life cycles of multiple programming languages and domains (how to develop, debug, package, test, etc.) as we have code in several languages, ranging from Python, Go and JavaScript.
  Solid understanding of relational databases (e.g. Postgres).
  Strong desire to make code reviews amazing with helpful and productive feedback.
  Experience in an Agile DevOps engineering environment that effectively uses CI/CD pipelines (GitLab, Github).
  Experience working with multiple cloud providers (like AWS, GCP, and Azure) and delivering software as a service, working with cloud infrastructure services such as AWS EC2, S3, Kubernetes, etc.
  Familiarity with hybrid delivery models, delivering software to both customer-managed and cloud-hosted environments.
  Excellent communication skills and a history of leading and collaborating with cross-functional teams.
  Familiarity with information security is a huge plus
